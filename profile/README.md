## About Us

Current Research Interests
- Biosignal Specialized MLLMs: Constructing domain-specific multimodal large language models, such as ECG-R1, GEM, and SpiroLLM, to bridge the semantic gap between time-series biosignals and clinical language.
- Biosignal Foundation Models: Developing generalist foundation models, such as ECGFounder, SleepFounder, AnyECG, AnyPPG, by leveraging large-scale, multi-modality databases to enable robust representation learning and zero-shot generalization across diverse clinical tasks.
- Digital Biomarker Discovery: Establishing a systematic paradigm, such as Sleep Depth Index, PPGage, ECGomics, to transform high-dimensional biosignals into structured, quantifiable metrics.
- AI for Digital Health: Enhancing smart devices with AI, including Portable ECG Device, Flexible ECG Patch, ECG Pad, smart ring (with PPG sensor), smart stethoscope (with PCG sensor).
- Real-World Clinical Validation: Conducting rigorous real-world studies, including opportunistic screening systems for AVBI/LQTS, WPW, SVT, AF, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to evaluate the clinical efficacy and implementation pathways of AI-ECG interventions.
